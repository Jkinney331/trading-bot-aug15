## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive handoff documentation for the AI Trading Bot project, structured for phase-by-phase CTO review via GitHub with AI agents. The project has successfully completed Phase 1, achieving 50% of the Statement of Work (SOW) requirements with a fully functional React-based trading dashboard integrated with Alpaca paper trading.

### Critical Context for Review
- **Original Platform:** Binance (SOW requirement)
- **Current Platform:** Alpaca (strategic pivot for compliance and immediate availability)
- **Future Migration:** Binance integration deferred to Phase 5
- **Key Innovation:** AdaptiveThreshold ML service providing pre-RL intelligent parameter optimization

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Trading (COMPLETE - 50%)

### What Was Built

#### 1. React Trading Dashboard (Frontend)
- **Technology:** React 18.3 + Vite 5.4 + TypeScript 5.5

  - Authentication via Supabase
  - Live market data integration with CoinGecko
  - Automated trading controls with confidence thresholds
  - Performance analytics and metrics visualization
  - Market sentiment analysis via Groq AI
  - Position and order management interface

#### 2. Autonomous Trading Agent
- **Location:** `/src/services/tradingAgent.ts`
- **Capabilities:**
  - 45-second automated trading cycles
  - Multi-indicator technical analysis (RSI, MACD, MA20/50)
  - Risk-adjusted position sizing
  - 5 cryptocurrency coverage (BTC, ETH, BNB, ADA, SOL)
  - Confidence-based signal generation

#### 3. Alpaca Integration Layer
- **Location:** `/src/services/alpacaService.ts`
- **Features:**
  - Paper trading account management
  - Real-time order execution
  - Position tracking and P&L calculation
  - WebSocket price feeds (future enhancement)

#### 4. AdaptiveThreshold ML Service (Pre-RL)
- **Location:** `/backend/ml-service/`
- **Innovation:** Gradient-based parameter optimization
- **Key Features:**
  - Dynamic threshold adjustment based on performance
  - Multi-user and multi-symbol support
  - Performance tracking with SQLite
  - RESTful API for integration
  - Docker containerization ready

### Why These Choices

1. **React + Vite Instead of Next.js**
   - Faster development cycles with HMR
   - Simpler deployment for client-side app
   - Better suited for real-time trading UI
   - Reduced complexity for Phase 1 MVP

2. **Alpaca Over Binance (Initial)**
   - Immediate API key availability
   - Paper trading removes capital risk during development
   - Regulatory compliance for US operations
   - Easier testing and validation

3. **AdaptiveThreshold Before Full RL**
   - Provides immediate value with simpler implementation
   - Creates performance baseline for RL comparison
   - Establishes feedback loop infrastructure
   - Lower computational requirements

### How It Addresses SOW Requirements

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Limitations (Phase 1)

1. **Browser Dependency:** Requires browser tab open for trading
2. **Limited Coverage:** Only 5 cryptocurrencies (vs 50+ required)
3. **Execution Speed:** 45-second cycles (vs sub-100ms required)
4. **Paper Trading Only:** No real capital deployment yet

### Technical Debt

1. **Frontend State Management:** Consider Redux/Zustand for complex state
2. **Error Boundaries:** Need comprehensive error handling
3. **Test Coverage:** Currently <40%, target >80%
4. **Documentation:** API documentation needs completion

### Security Considerations

1. **API Keys:** Currently in environment variables (secure for dev)
